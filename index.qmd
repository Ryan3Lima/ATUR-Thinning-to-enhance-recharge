abstract: 

    Literature on the relationship between forest thinning and water yield was used to develop suitability criteria to map where forest treatment is most likely to enhance groundwater recharge across the Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of Arizona. Rechage in the ponderosa pine forests is ephemeral and focused in periods of snowmelt and locations of enhanced permeability when soil moisture exceeds threshold levels. Our approach combines thematic maps of criteria such as snow dominance, slope, aspect,landscape morphology, forest basal area, canopy cover, lineament density, lithology and hydrologic soil type into a GIS-Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) model. Individual criteria were grouped into indices and weighted using Analytic Hierarch Process (AHP). A total of 863,648 hectares or 46.8% of the 1.8 million hectares of Ponderosa Pine forests were found to be highly suitable for groundwater recharge enhancment from forest thinning.  Similar approaches and criteria selection can be applied to other areas in the Southwestern US and othr forest types to identify areas for forest thinning for potential recharge benefits.  
    
key-points:
 - Produced suitability map of where forest thinning may reduce evaporative demand increasing water available for streamflow and recharge in Ponderosa Pine forests throughout the State of Arizona.
  - About 47% of Arizona's Ponderosa Pine forests are suitable for thinning to enhance recharge.
  - Rainfall runoff modeling would compliment this work.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has led to a doubling in the frequency of extreme hydroclimate events in the Colorado River Basin since 2010, including droughts, heatwaves, and floods [@bennett_concurrent_2021]. Since 2000, the Colorado River Basin has been in the midst of a historic drought [@meko_treering_2022; @williams_rapid_2022]. Over this time period, streamflow in the Colorado River has declined by 19% relative to the 1906-1999 average ##; [@hogan_recent_2024; @udall_twentyfirst_2017]. Rapid population growth in the Southwest and Arizona, in particular, is increasing the demands on already strained water supplies in the State. Reductions in streamflow have increased reliance on groundwater pumping, resulting in groundwater declines across Arizona [@tadych_historical_2024]. Analyses of regional gravity data have suggested that groundwater loss rate in the Colorado River Basin may far exceed the depletion rate of Lake Powell and Lake Mead and that groundwater may account for a more significant portion of water use than previously thought [@castle2014].

Warming temperatures have also tripled the frequency and quadrupled the size of wildfires since 2000 [@iglesias2022]. The risk of catastrophic wildfires is increasing in Western forests--an emerging driver of runoff change that will increase the impact on the water supply [@williams_rapid_2022]. Forest structure in Northern Arizona has changed significantly post-Euro-American settlement. Many forests are overstocked relative to pre-settlement conditions due to grazing, logging, and wildfire exclusion [@covington_southwestern_1994; @friederici2013]\]. These changes have increased the risk of catastrophic wildfires [@allen2002]. Rising temperatures and droughts have contributed to extensive tree mortality from disease and insect infestation, making forested areas more vulnerable to wildfires [@berner_tree_2017].

Forest treatments such as thinning and prescribed burning can significantly impact the hydrologic cycle of forests [@del_campo_global_2022]. For example, forest thinning in Arizona has been associated with increased snow cover days [@sankey_multi-scale_2015; @belmonte_uav-based_2021; @donager_integrating_2021], greater soil moisture [@belmonte_soil_2022; @sankey_thinning_2022], and greater forest canopy moisture [@sankey_regionalscale_2021].

Numerous studies have linked forest treatments to increased water yields in semi-arid forests and have emphasized the role of forest restoration in improving hydrologic services and increasing water availability [@bosch1982; @baker_effects_1986; @gottfried_moderate_1991; @smerdon_overview_2009; @zou_streamflow_2010; @wyatt2013; @moreno_modeling_2015; @simonit_impact_2015; @wyatt2015; @odonnell_forest_2018; @schenk_impacts_2020; @hibbert1979]. While the connection between forest treatment and water yield is well documented, the response of forests to treatments is complex and non-linear and differs across forest types, with treatment level, and along aspect and elevational gradients [@delcampo2022; @biederman_streamflow_2022; @zou_streamflow_2010; @hibbert1979; @moore2005];.

Regardless of the potential for increased water yield, the enhancement of groundwater recharge rarely, if ever, ranks among the primary motivations for forest treatment, even among projects with the stated goal of improving watershed health \[[@stanturf2014; @filoso2017; @allen2002; @friederici2013; @odonnell2016]. Studies that surveyed public willingness to pay for forest restoration to enhance groundwater recharge were the lowest among the environmental services discussed in the survey, behind critical habitat protections, surface water quality improvements, and preservation of cultural values[@mueller2019; @soder2022]. This suggests that groundwater recharge is either undervalued by the public as an ecosystem service or a low priority relative to other environmental goods.

Forest health and water security are intimately linked. About 66% of the water supply in 11 western states comes from Forested Lands [@brown_source_2005]. Despite this, the management of lands and waters is still largely compartmentalized. The Western Water Network (WWN) identified the need to promote better and faster collaboration between researchers, managers, educators, industry, and stakeholders across the West [@hansen2024]. This study examines forest restoration through the lens of groundwater recharge enhancement and aims to identify potential recharge zones. Specifically, we demonstrate a suitability mapping approach to identify areas where forest thinning may enhance recharge. Suitability maps like these may complement (or supplement) existing frameworks for jointly prioritizing landscape-scale forest management and managing lands and water.

Suitability mapping, particularly GIS-based Multi-criteria decision making (GIS-MCDM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), have been widely used to map potential recharge zones and areas suitable for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) in areas underlain by karst lithologies [@fathi2021; @rajashekar2023; @rahman2012; @dar2020; @shaban2006]. However this study is the first to examine where forest restoration may be sited to enhance un-managed recharge at a landscape scale. This study finds that much of the area where thinning is planned for the purpose of restoring other ecosystem services may also improve groundwater management in a state facing serious groundwater declines.

## Study Area

Our study area includes all of the HUC8 watersheds of Arizona, extending into 5 other states but excluding Mexico. However within that study area we focus on the Ponderosa Pine woodland type. Ponderosa Pine woodlands cover 1.8 million hectares (1,835,530.65) of this study area or around 30% (28.38%) of the forested area within its bounds. Most of the ponderosa pine forest is found along the Mogollon Rim, around the San Francisco Peaks, and on the Kaibab Plateau--all within the Colorado Plateau physiographic region at elevations between 1800 m and 2400 m. Smaller isolated patches of Ponderosa Pine forest can be found on mountain ranges and plateaus throughout Arizona at similar elevations.

The Mogollon Rim is a topographic feature forming the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. It contains the majority of the state's ponderosa pine forests and has been identified as an essential groundwater recharge area for regional aquifers [@parker2005]. Of the estimated 2.1 billion \$m\^3\$ (174,000 acre-feet) of precipitation that falls on the Mogollon Rim, about 8% is estimated to recharge the regional groundwater aquifers[@parker2005] Similarly, The Kaibab Plateau, an uplifted region north of the Grand Canyon with large stands of ponderosa pine, is a critically important recharge area for springs in the Grand Canyon which provide the sole source of drinking water for over 6 million annual visitors and the residents of the National Park[@tobin2018]. The Kaibab plateau lacks perennial surface streams and is drained rapidly by sinkholes, faults, and fractures or more slowly through diffuse infiltration with little streamflow leaving the plateau [@jones2018; @huntoon1974].

Most of the Ponderosa Pine forest within the State is within the Kaibab, Coconino, Apache-Sitgreaves, and Tonto National forests. Precipitation in Arizona is bi-modal, with wet winters and a late-summer monsoon season. As much as 60% of precipitation at elevations above 1800 m comes in the form of snow and snow is responsible for 80 - 95% of streamflow and a much of the recharge [@baker2013; @eastoe2023]. Therefore this research focuses on high-elevation (\>1800 m) ponderosa pine forests which receive a high proportion of annual precipitation as snow. Of the 1.8 million Ha of Ponderosa pine forests in our study area, about 43% or 786,706 hectares are underlain by lithologies that may support karst or pseudo karst features, including carbonates (24%), evaporates (6%), and fractured volcanics (13%). These areas merit extra attention due to enhanced infiltration potential through fractures, faults, lava tubes, or sinkholes.

## Literature Review and Criteria

This research aims to identify areas where mechanical thinning is most likely to enhance groundwater recharge. We based our suitability criteria on literature primarily from regional studies, as they are likely the best predictors of hydrologic response to thinning in Arizona's forests [@wyatt_estimating_2013]. Landscape-scale forest restoration efforts have been planned or implemented across much of Arizona. For example, the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) includes plans for restoration across over 1 million hectares of Arizona's forests [@schultz_collaborative_2012]. A synthesis of 4FRI treatments found that thinned and burned forests have significantly greater total ecosystem moisture and are thus more resilient to drought and wildfire [@sankey_thinning_2022; @sankey_regionalscale_2021]. Thinned forests also have more snow and soil moisture [@odonnell_vegetation_2021; @belmonte_soil_2022].

The snow and its persistence appear particularly important for recharge in Arizona's semi-arid and high-elevation conifer forests. Analysis of groundwater issuing from springs along the Mogollon rim found a strong relationship between snow persistence and the duration of spring discharge [@donovan2022]. Isotopic groundwater analyses have revealed that Northern Arizona's recharge is dominated by winter precipitation from altitudes above 1500 m[@eastoe2007; @eastoe2023; @earman2006; @blasch2006]. Studies of plant water use have found that larger ponderosa pine trees primarily utilize deeper soil moisture from winter precipitation, while understory vegetation and smaller trees utilize shallow soil water from monsoonal storms, informing our approach to focusing on ponderosa pine trees for this analysis [@kerhoulas2013; @kerhoulas2023].

Thinning in Ponderosa Pine forests is expected to increase available water in two primary ways. 1) reducing transpiration of deep soil water by overstory vegetation and 2) reducing canopy interception of snow and subsequent sublimation, increasing below-canopy snow depth and snow persistence. Thinning in semi-arid forested watersheds can significantly alter snowmelt timing [@dwivedi2024]. Reduced forest cover can delay snowmelt at colder sites, higher elevations, and northern aspects or advance snowmelt through increasing sub-canopy solar radiation and wind, particularly at lower elevations, southern aspects, and warmer sites [@biederman_recent_2015; @dwivedi2024].

Total annual precipitation also appears to influence whether thinning reduces or enhances water yield at particular sites. In the Colorado River Basin, there appears to be a precipitation threshold at work. Below \~500mm of annual precipitation, precipitation and runoff may become decoupled [@biederman2022], likely because below \~500mm, most precipitation is evaporated regardless of forest condition. Semi-arid forests with high inter-annual precipitation variability may show effects in wet years when precipitation is greater than \~500mm or in snow-dominant watersheds [@adams2012].

Canopy cover between 25% and 40% appears optimal for net snow accumulation at continental mid-latitude sites [@veatch2009]. UAV-based studies within the study area have shown that 24 - 35% canopy cover was optimal for snow persistence. [@donager2021; @sankey_multi-scale_2015; @belmonte_uav-based_2021]. However, water yield enhancement from thinning likely requires at least a 20% reduction in canopy cover[@adams_ecohydrological_2012]. Hydrologic models in northern Arizona watersheds suggest that reductions in basal area of at least 30% can increase groundwater recharge by up to 15% [@wyatt2015].

Research on the effect of thinning to below-ground hydrological processes in semi-arid Mediterranean forests found that sites with high antecedent soil moisture had the highest response, with drainage to deeper soil layers increasing by 50 mm/year relative to control sites[@del_campo_effectiveness_2019]. The soil type (texture, composition, field capacity, and permeability) and topography affect the soil moisture. Slope, Aspect, landscape convexity or concavity, and geomorphons (or landform types) such as pits, flats, hills, valleys, ridges, and hollows strongly affect the accumulation and residence time of overland flow and shallow soil water[@parker1982; @jasiewicz2013]. In dry soils, capillary forces generally dominate over gravitational forces, and areas with higher flow accumulation and residence time are more likely to reach field capacity, leading to more percolation[@woessner2020].

Another important aspect affecting recharge enhancement potential is the underlying lithology, which controls the subsurface flow of groundwater. The state currently lacks detailed hydrogeologic mapping. However, representative ranges of primary (matrix) permeability and porosity values for rock types are available based on 1:1,000,000 and 1:500,000 geologic mapping data[@huscroft2018; @freeze1979; @woessner2020]. Secondary permeability and porosity, which involve flow in faults and fractures, can be estimated to some degree by measuring the density of linear surface features, or 'lineaments,' which often correspond to underlying geologic structures [@oleary1976; @sander2007]. Lineaments have been used to identify potential groundwater supplies, and studies have found higher well yields along lineaments [@sander2007]. In some crystalline bedrock, groundwater flow occurs exclusively in faults and fractures [@meijerink2007; @nyborg2007]. Orientations of lineaments can help determine the anisotropy of the fracture environment[@meijerink2007]. Caves and sinkholes (or dolines) often form along and at the intersection of faults and fractures in karst terrains [@ford2007]. Karst and pseudo-karst terrains can have enhanced infiltration potential far beyond the hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix [@kresic2013]. For example, the Edwards Aquifer in Texas was found to have permeability values that vary by up to nine orders of magnitude [@halihan1998]. The presence or absence of karst or pseudo karst in concert with lineament density are critical criterion made explicit in our suitability analysis.

In summary, suitability for sites where thinning enhances recharge would most likely occur in areas with significant snowfall, maximum annual precipitation \>= 500mm, higher antecedent soil moisture, NE aspects, in valleys or flat areas where a 20% reduction in canopy cover and a 30% reduction in basal area would result in a thinned canopy cover of between 25 and 35%. Suitability would be lowest in sites with minimal snowfall, SW aspects, lower elevations, ridge tops, or steep slopes, where thinning might reduce canopy cover to below 24%. Soil Hydraulic Conductivity, flow accumulation, and topographic metrics can reveal the areas likely to have higher antecedent soil moisture. Lithology, primary permeability and porosity, and lineament density can provide insight into where rapid subsurface infiltration is possible.

# Methods

## Suitability Criteria

We used ArcGIS Pro 3.4.0 to create a weighted suitability model consisting of the 12 thematic data layers shown in @tbl-Thematic. These were re-scaled, weighted, and combined into four high-level indices: 1) Snow Dominance, 2) Vegetation Density Index, 3) Soil Wetness and surface infiltration index, and 4) subsurface infiltration index.

#### Topographic Relative Moisture Index

Topographic Relative Moisture Index (TRMI) incorporates several topographic parameters that influence moisture dynamics, including slope gradient, aspect, relative elevation (or topographic position), and landscape convexity or concavity [@parker1982]. TRMI was calculated by ranking Slope (degrees) (1-10), Slope Configuration (Topographic Position Index) (1-10), Geomorphon (ArcGIS Pro 3.4.0 Spatial Analyst Toolbox--Geomorphon Landform Tool) (1-20), and aspect (degrees azimuth) (1-20). Values were summed to calculate a TRMI score between 4 and 60, classified into 10-classes with equal intervals.

#### Matrix Permeability and Porosity

Permeability and Porosity values were extracted from the GLobal Hydrogeology MaPS 2.0 (GLHYMPS v2) dataset [@huscroft2018]. Our study area contained XXX polygons with values for saturated log-permeability ranging from -16 to -10, and porosity values ranging from 0.01 - 0.28. The attribute values were extracted and the polygons were rasterized at a 30m resolution, then re-scaled to values (1-10) as shown in @tbl-glhymps and in figure.

#### Lineament Density

Lineaments were extracted semi-automatically using 1-arc-second DEM tiles available from the national map. Topographic Position Index (TPI) provides estimates of relative neighborhood convexity and concavity and was calculated using a circular neighborhood with a radius of 5m. The TPI layer was then displayed as a multi-directional hillshade and exported from ArcGIS to Catalyst where the LINE module was used to detect edges and link lines. The Default parameters were utilized and the resulting lineaments were brought into ArcGIS and cleaned to remove any edge effects. A second lineament analysis was conducted using the standard deviation of elevation with a circular neighborhood and a radius of 5m. This raster was also displayed as a multi-directional hillshade and exported, and lineaments were again extracted using the LINE module. These two rasters provided complementary sets of combined lineaments. Due to the resolution and parameters chosen, man-made lineaments (roads, railways, and powerlines) were not largely delineated by the algorithm in either analysis; however, buffers around roads were randomly sampled and spot-checked to ensure man-made lineaments were not included.

#### Potential Karst or Pseudo-Karst

## Index Weighting

Research on water yield in burned forests in the Salt-Verde watersheds (within and adjacent to the CNF) found that warmer low-elevation forests, an forests with southern aspects which saw reductions in canopy cover due to wildfire had lower water yields relative to higher elevation and cooler aspects [@biederman2015; @biederman2022b].

Topographic Relative Moisture Index (TRMI) incorporates several topographic parameters that influence moisture dynamics, including slope gradient, aspect, relative elevation (or topographic position), and landscape convexity or concavity [@parker1982].TRMI was calculated by ranking Slope (degrees) (1-10), Slope Configuration (Topographic Position Index) (1-10), Geomorphon (ArcGIS Pro 3.4.0 Spatial Analyst Toolbox--Geomorphon Landform Tool) (1-20), and aspect (degrees azimuth) (1-20). Values were summed to calculate a TRMI score between 4 and 60, classified into 10-classes with equal intervals.

### Basal Area

We extracted basal area estimates from the TreeMap 2016 [@riley2022] CONUS dataset with a resolution of 30 meters. Estimates of pre-settlement ponderosa pine forest basal area were between 9.2 and 18 $m^2$/ha Since basal area reductions of at least 30% are required to see increases in water yield. In order to remove 30% of the basal area and have thinned forests remain within the historical range of pre-settlement forest density forests with density

### Mean Annual Precipitation

Utilized AORC Retrospective forcing data for average water year (WY) precipitation 1991 - 2020

### Subsurface Infiltration Capacity

We utilized the Global Hydrological Maps of Permeability and Porosity (GLHYMPS) to estimate subsurface infiltration capacity [@gleeson2014]

### Soil Hydrologic Type

**TO DO** ***eventually we should replace Hydrologic Soil Type with a Soil Infiltration Index composed of Soil Saturated Ksat (weight = 0.5), Depth to bedrock (weight = 0.3) and Drainage Class (0.2), after normalizing each variable we can combine them into a matrix which will provide a better weighting scheme than just applying values 0-10 to hydrologic class.***

Hydrologic Soil Type data from gNATSGO was used to estimate the soil's ability to infiltrate water. Four soil types were identified within the study area (fig soil) which were subsequently reclassified from 4 - 10 according to the tablex below.

### Canopy Cover

NEHA SUGGESTS REMOVING REDUNDANCIES from INTRO

Reconstructions of pre-settlement ponderosa pine forests have found a range of canopy covers between 10% and 22%, with a median of 16.7% canopy cover[@huffman2012]. However, UAV-analyses of snow pack in thinned and un-thinned ponderosa pine forests within the study area found that canopy cover is highly predictive of snow persistence and that 24 - 35% canopy cover was optimal for maintaining snowpack. [@donager2021; @sankey_multi-scale_2015; @belmonte_uav-based_2021]. However a reduction of 20% canopy cover is necessary to reduce ET and enhance water yield [@adams_ecohydrological_2012] . However thinning treatments are costly and several studies have shown that thinning treatments can lead to soil compaction and reduced infiltration [@moreno2016]. Maximum suitability, then would be the areas with 29-42% canopy cover where the a 20% reduction would result in forests with canopy covers of between 24% and 35%. Higher forest covers could also be suitable but would require more thinning and likely more soil compaction. We set the minimum suitability at 12% canopy cover, since a minimum 20% reduction would result in canopy cover of about 10% the low end of the canopy cover found in pre-settlement forests [@huffman2012].

Canopy Cover was obtained from the 2021 National Land Cover Database , which provides an estimate of Total Canopy Cover (figure x). Canopy cover values ranged from 0% - 86%, the canopy cover data was reclassified using a Gaussian (parabolic) function centering on 35%. The maximum threshold was left at 86%, while the minimum threshold was set to 20%, with a spread of 0.0085. In this way, regions with canopy cover approaching 35% were classified as 10, and suitability classification decreased continuously as canopy cover diverged from th 35% target value.

## Weighting

Pairwise comparisons between each variable were made using the [INOWAS GIS MCDA tool](https://www.inowas.com/tools/t05-gis-mcda/). The pairwise comparisons were The resulting weight schema is presented in Table 1. The weighting had a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.031, values less than 0.1 are considered consistent.

## Model

# Results

The study area contained 1.8 million hectares of Ponderosa Pine forest. Approximately 26% (473,458 hectares) of the ponderosa pine forest was deemed highly suitable for thinning to enhance recharge with suitability values between 6.48 and 8.85 (out of 10), a further 33% of the ponderosa pine forest can be considered suitable for thinning to enhance recharge (610,013 hectares) with suitability values between 5.42 and 6.48. The remainder of the ponderosa pine forest is moderate suitability, low suitability, or not suitable for thinning to enhance recharge 41.28% (761,781 hectares). Only about 3% of the ponderosa pine forest classified as very high and high suitability fall within wilderness boundaries.

# Conclusion

-   There are significant portions of the Coconino forest that if thinned, are likely to enhance groundwater recharge, however these are not the only benefits. While this study was aimed at maximizing recharge, these same areas are also likely to reduce wildfire risk and improve watershed function enhancing other hydrologic services.

# Discussion

-   novel application of MCDA for mapping areas where forest thinning may enhance groundwater recharge.

-   It could be adapted to other semi-arid forested

-   The Forest Service has a mandate to manage for multiple uses; however, groundwater recharge is not currently an explicitly managed use. Analyses like these can help identify areas that could be managed with aquifer recharge in mind.

## Future Work

-   It is important to adjust the suitability map to capture secondary and tertiary permeability and porosity in areas underlain by karst. This would require improved hydrogeologic mapping of karst surface features paired with dye tracing to understand karst flow paths and areas of high recharge potential.

-   The soil criteria could be refined by mapping soil Hydraulic conductivity and field capacity rather than just using soil types A---D, providing more detail.

-   could be validated with modeling using SWAT or other models

-   Paired watershed studies such as those planned in the Lake Mary Watershed with groundwater monitoring can be used to validate and fine-tune model weighting and decision rules between criteria.

-   this methodology could be used across the 2.6 million acres of Ponderosa Pine forest in Arizona and New mexico

-   State-wide and regional geologic mapping in Arizona is currently only at the 1:500,000 scale, more detailed data could improve this type of suitability mapping.

Arizona lacks detailed hydrogeologic mapping throughout much of the state. The State Geologic map within the State Geologic Mapping Compliation contains geologic units and faults mapped to the 1:500,000 scale. However digitized lineaments, particularly faults are limited to very large faults state-wide and are almost completely absent in the North Eastern part of the state on the Navajo Nation and Colorado Plateau.

Springs, being the intersections of groundwater flow and the land surface, are convenient locations to monitor the effects of land management on groundwater recharge. Though tracer studies are needed to connect specific springs to particular recharge areas, continuous monitoring of springs and the baseflow component of perennial spring-fed rivers can inform land managers of the effectiveness of thinning in enhancing recharge and help validate suitability analyses.
