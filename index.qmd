abstract: 
    Literature on the relationship between forest thinning and water yield was used to develop suitability criteria to map where forest treatment is most likely to enhance groundwater recharge across the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. Rechage in the region is ephemeral and focused in periods of snowmelt and locations of enhanced permeability when soil moisture exceeds threshold levels. Our approach combines thematic maps of criteria such as average precipitation, snow dominance, slope, aspect,landscape morphology, forest basal area, canopy cover, lithology and hydrologic soil type into a GIS-Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) model. Pairwise comparisons were made between criteria, and Analytic Hierachy Process was used as a weighting method.
key-points:
  - Produced suitability map of where forest thinning may reduce evaporative demand increasing water available for streamflow and recharge throughout the State of Arizona
  - Rainfall runoff modeling would compliment this work

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has led to a doubling in the frequency of extreme hydroclimate events in the Colorado River Basin since 2010, including droughts, heatwaves, and floods [@bennett_concurrent_2021]. Since 2000, the Colorado River Basin has been in the midst of a historic drought [@meko_treering_2022; @williams_rapid_2022]. During that time, streamflow in the Colorado River has declined by 19% relative to the 1906-1999 average [@hogan_recent_2024; @udall_twentyfirst_2017]. Rapid population growth in the Southwest and Arizona, in particular, is increasing the demands on already strained water supplies in the State. Reductions in streamflow have increased reliance on groundwater pumping, resulting in groundwater declines across Arizona [@tadych_historical_2024]. Analyses of regional gravity data have suggested that the rate of groundwater loss in the Colorado River Basin may far exceed the depletion rate of Lake Powell and Lake Mead and that groundwater may account for a more significant portion of water use than previously thought [@castle2014].

Concurrently, the risk of catastrophic wildfires is increasing in Western forests--an emerging driver of runoff change that will increase the impact on the water supply [@williams_rapid_2022]. Forest structure in Northern Arizona and New Mexico has changed significantly post-Euro-American settlement. Many forests are overstocked relative to pre-settlement conditions due to grazing, logging, and wildfire exclusion [@covington_southwestern_1994; @friederici2013]. These changes have increased the risk of catastrophic wildfires [@allen_ecological_2002]. Rising temperatures and droughts have contributed to extensive tree mortality from wildfire, disease, and insect infestation [@berner_tree_2017]. Warming temperatures have tripled the frequency and quadrupled the size of wildfires since 2000 [@iglesias2022].

Landscape-scale forest restoration efforts have been planned or implemented across much of Arizona. For example, the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) includes plans for restoration across over 1 million hectares of Arizona's forests [@schultz_collaborative_2012]. The primary goal of restoration efforts is to reduce wildfire risk [@allen_ecological_2002; @friederici2013]. However, numerous studies have linked forest treatments to increased water yields in semi-arid forests and have emphasized the role of forest restoration in improving hydrologic services and increasing water availability [@bosch_review_1982; @baker_effects_1986; @gottfried_moderate_1991; @smerdon_overview_2009; @zou_streamflow_2010; @wyatt_estimating_2013; @moreno_modeling_2015; @simonit_impact_2015; @wyatt_semiarid_2015; @odonnell_forest_2018; @schenk_impacts_2020; @hibbert1979]. Forest treatments such as thinning and burning can significantly impact the hydrologic cycle of forests [@del_campo_global_2022]. For example, forest thinning in Arizona has been associated with increased snow cover days [@sankey_multi-scale_2015; @belmonte_uav-based_2021; @donager_integrating_2021], greater soil moisture [@belmonte_soil_2022; @sankey_thinning_2022], and greater forest canopy moisture [@sankey_regionalscale_2021].

While the connection between forest treatment and water yield is well documented, the response of forests to treatments is complex and non-linear and differs across forest types, with treatment level, and along aspect and elevational gradients [@del_campo_global_2022; @biederman_streamflow_2022; @zou_streamflow_2010; @hibbert1979; @moore_physical_2005]. Regardless of the potential for increased water yield, the enhancement of groundwater recharge rarely, if ever, ranks among the primary motivations for forest treatment, even among projects with the stated goal of improving watershed health [@stanturf2014; @filoso2017; @allen_ecological_2002; @friederici2013; @odonnell2016]. Studies that surveyed public willingness to pay for forest restoration to enhance groundwater recharge were the lowest among the environmental services discussed in the survey, behind critical habitat protections, surface water quality improvements, and preservation of cultural values[@mueller2019; @soder2022]. This suggests that groundwater recharge is either undervalued by the public as an ecosystem service or a low priority relative to other environmental goods.

Forest health and water security are intimately linked. About 66% of the water supply in 11 western states comes from Forested Lands [@brown_source_2005]. Despite this, the management of lands and waters is still largely compartmentalized. The Western Water Network (WWN) identified the need to promote better and faster collaboration between researchers, managers, educators, industry, and stakeholders across the West [@hansen2024]. This study examines forest restoration through the lens of groundwater recharge enhancement and aims to identify potential recharge zones. We mapped suitability for forest thinning to enhance recharge. Suitability maps like these may complement (or supplement) existing frameworks for jointly prioritizing landscape-scale forest management and managing lands and water.

Suitability mapping, and particularly GIS-based Multi-criteria decision making (GIS-MCDM), is widely used to map potential recharge zones and areas suitable for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), but to our knowledge, it has not yet been implemented to map incidental recharge or recharge enhancement potential, from forest thinning [@fathi2021; @rajashekar2023; @rahman2012]. Pairwise comparisons were made between criteria including forest basal area, canopy cover, average precipitation, snow dominance, slope, aspect, landscape morphology, forest density, lithology, and hydrologic soil type.

## Study Area

The Coconino National Forest (CNF) is located in northern Arizona near Flagstaff and Sedona. Its elevation ranges from 790 m near the Verde River to 3,851 m at the summit of Humphreys Peak. The Coconino National Forest spans the Mogollon Rim, a topographic feature forming the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. The Mogollon Rim has been identified as an essential groundwater recharge area for regional aquifers [@parker2005]. Of the estimated 2.1 billion $m^3$ (174,000 acre-feet of precipitation that falls on the Mogollon Rim, about 8% is estimated to recharge the regional groundwater aquifers[@parker2005]. Precipitation along the Mogollon Rim is bi-modal, with wet winters and a late-summer monsoon season.

CNF is located within North America's largest contiguous ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest. Ponderosa pine covers roughly 40% of the national forest's area of about 340,000 ha, primarily between 2000 and 2400 m in elevation. While the Ponderosa Pine forest is the most extensive vegetation type, CNF hosts various shrub and sagebrush communities and pinyon Juniper forests at lower elevations. Mixed conifer forests dominated by spruce, pine, and fir at higher elevations can be found along with sporadic aspen stands.

## Background

This research aims to identify areas where mechanical thinning is most likely to enhance groundwater recharge. We based our suitability criteria on literature primarily from regional studies, as they are likely the best predictors of hydrologic response to thinning in Arizona's forests [@wyatt_estimating_2013]. A synthesis of 4FRI treatments found that thinned and burned forests have significantly greater total ecosystem moisture and are thus more resilient to drought and wildfire, which can buffer forests against the effects of drought impacts [@sankey_thinning_2022; @sankey_regionalscale_2021]. Thinned forests also tend to have more snow and soil moisture [@odonnell_vegetation_2021].

The snow and its persistence appear particularly important for recharge in Arizona's semi-arid and high-elevation conifer forests. Analysis of groundwater issuing from springs along the Mogollon rim found a strong relationship between snow persistence and the duration of spring discharge [@donovan2022]. Isotopic groundwater analyses have revealed that Northern Arizona's recharge is dominated by winter precipitation from altitudes above 1500 m[@eastoe2007; @eastoe2023; @earman2006; @blasch2006]. Studies of plant water use have found that larger ponderosa pine trees primarily utilize deeper soil moisture from winter precipitation, while understory vegetation and smaller trees utilize shallow soil water from monsoonal storms [@kerhoulas2013; @kerhoulas2023].

Thinning in semi-arid and high-elevation forests (greater than 1500 meters in altitude) is expected to increase available water in two primary ways. 1) reducing transpiration of deep soil water by overstory vegetation and 2) reducing canopy interception of snow and subsequent sublimation, increasing below-canopy snow depth and snow persistence. Thinning in semi-arid forested watersheds can significantly alter snowmelt timing [@dwivedi2024]. Reduced forest cover can delay snowmelt at colder sites at higher elevations or northern aspects or through increasing sub-canopy solar radiation and wind, resulting in earlier snowmelt, particularly at lower elevation or southern aspect warmer sites [@biederman_recent_2015; @dwivedi2024]. Research on the effect of thinning to below-ground hydrological processes in semi-arid Mediterranean forests found that sites with high antecedent soil moisture had the highest response, with drainage to deeper soil layers increasing by 50 mm/year relative to control sites[@del_campo_effectiveness_2019].

Canopy cover between 25% and 40% appears optimal for net snow accumulation at continental mid-latitude sites [@veatch2009]. UAV-based studies within the study area have shown that 24 - 35% canopy cover was optimal for snow persistence. [@donager2021; @sankey_multi-scale_2015; @belmonte_uav-based_2021]. However, water yield enhancement from thinning likely requires at least a 20% reduction in canopy cover[@adams_ecohydrological_2012]. Hydrologic models in northern Arizona watersheds suggest that reductions in basal area of at least 30% can increase groundwater recharge by up to 15% [@wyatt2015].

Total annual precipitation also appears to influence weather thinning, which will reduce or enhance water yield at particular sites. In the Colorado River Basin, there appears to be a precipitation threshold at work. Below \~500mm of annual precipitation, precipitation and runoff may become decoupled [@biederman_streamflow_2022], likely because below \~500mm, most precipitation is evaporated regardless of forest condition [@hibbert1979]. Semi-arid forests with high inter-annual precipitation variability may show effects in wet years when precipitation is greater than \~500mm [@adams2012].

Suitability for sites where thinning enhances recharge would most likely occur in sites with significant snowfall, maximum annual precipitaiton \>= 500mm, higher antecedent soil moisture, NE aspects, in valleys or flat areas where a 20% reduction in canopy cover and a 30% reduction in basal area would result in a thinned canopy cover of between 25 and 35%. Suitability would be lowest in sites with minimal snowfall, SW aspects, lower elevations, ridge tops, or steep slopes, where thinning might reduce canopy cover to below 24%. In addition to soil and geologic hydraulic conductivity, these criteria are used for this suitability analysis.

# Methods

We used ArcGIS Pro 3.4.0 to create a weighted suitability model consisting of seven thematic data layers: Topographic Relative Moisture Index, basal area, canopy cover, snow dominance, mean annual precipitation, and surface and subsurface infiltration capacity. Next, we applied a binary layer to mask out unsuitable areas, including non-forested land covers, wilderness areas, and areas with maximum annual precipitation below 500 mm. After this initial screening process, thematic maps were created using criteria known to affect water yield in thinned forests.

**Travis and I have discussed whether the mask should be before or after suitability is mapped. Travis suggests doing the binary masking of unsuitable areas after, which I think makes a lot of sense, but when scaled up, removing unsuitable areas will make processing faster**.

**Travis Commented: *Wilderness areas are more of a policy determinate than the physical limit. It may be better to remove policy considerations from this analysis or separate them as an independent processing step. In context with the larger state-wide analysis, it would be best to keep all policy considerations grouped together for simplicity. Having redundant policy masks inherent in sub-analysis could increase the models' complexity and result in errors.* I agree to some extent, but I also noticed that most of the suitable area was in the Kachina Peaks Wilderness Area, where it is unlikely that thinning will be undertaken. Still, I am open to removing wilderness from the screen-out process.**

## Initial Suitability Screening

There are many considerations for where thinning should be considered ecologically or geologically suitable for where thinning should be done. One example may be designated wilderness areas, where thinning may be incompatible with land use. management goals. We masked out all [wilderness areas](https://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/padus3/Fee_Managers/MapServer) within the CNF from consideration. This same technique could mask other areas that are managed for specific values incongruent with forest treatment or requiring specialized treatment.

Next, we masked out areas with maximum annual precipitation below 500 mm, consistent with the literature [@bosch1982; @hibbert1979b; @adams2012a; @biederman2022a]. This suggests that below about 500 mm of yearly precipitation, thinning does not seem to affect water yield. This is likely because below that threshold, most precipitation evaporates regardless of forest condition, resulting in little or no change in recharge.

**insert discussion on snow dominance**

We then screened out incompatible land uses/covers, using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and retaining only land cover classes: *41-deciduous forest*, *42-evergreen forest*, and *43-mixed forest.* Then we used the Landfire effective vegetation type (LF_EVT) maps and filtered out all forested areas with classes containing the keywords *urban, developed, agriculture, madrean*, or *savannah.*

### Topographic Relative Moisture Index

Research on water yield in burned forests in the Salt-Verde watersheds (within and adjacent to the CNF) found that warmer low-elevation forests, an forests with southern aspects which saw reductions in canopy cover due to wildfire had lower water yields relative to higher elevation and cooler aspects [@biederman2015; @biederman2022b].

Topographic Relative Moisture Index (TRMI) incorporates several topographic parameters that influence moisture dynamics, including slope gradient, aspect, relative elevation (or topographic position), and landscape convexity or concavity [@parker1982].TRMI was calculated by ranking Slope (degrees) (1-10), Slope Configuration (Topographic Position Index) (1-10), Geomorphon (ArcGIS Pro 3.4.0 Spatial Analyst Toolbox--Geomorphon Landform Tool) (1-20), and aspect (degrees azimuth) (1-2). Values were summed to calculate a TRMI score between 4 and 60, classified into 10-classes with equal intervals.

**New TRMI layer up on ArcGIS group, need to add it in and re-calculate**

| TRMI Values   | TRMI Suitability Scores |

| 54.401 - 60   | 10                      |

### Basal Area

We extracted basal area estimates from the TreeMap 2016 [@riley2022] CONUS dataset with a resolution of 30 meters. Estimates of pre-settlement ponderosa pine forest basal area were 11.5 $m^3$/ha or 50 $ft^3$/acre. Since basal area reductions of at least 30% are required to see increases in water yield. In order to remove 30% canopy cover and have forests with over 11.5 $m^3$/ha the starting basal area must be greater than 71.48 $ft^3$/acre.

### Snowfall Dominance

Ask Patrick Broxton how it was calculated.

### Mean Annual Precipitation

Utilized AORC Retrospective forcing data for average water year (WY) precipitation 1991 - 2020

![Mean Annual Precipitation for years 1991 - 2020](images/Mean_Annual_Precipitation.jpg)

### Subsurface Infiltration Capacity

We utilized the Global Hydrological Maps of Permeability and Porosity (GLHYMPS) to estimate subsurface infiltration capacity [@gleeson2014]

![Subsurface Infiltration Capacity, a combination of Permeability and Porosity values from the GLHYMPS dataset (Gleeson et al., 2014). Higher values (cooler colors) indicate higher infiltration capacity, while browner colors and lower values indicate lower infiltration capacity. Keep in mind this does not consider secondary or tertiary permeability or porosity due to faults, fractures, caves, and conduits.](images/GLHYMPS.jpg)

### Soil Hydrologic Type

**TO DO** ***eventually we should replace Hydrologic Soil Type with a Soil Infiltration Index composed of Soil Saturated Ksat (weight = 0.5), Depth to bedrock (weight = 0.3) and Drainage Class (0.2), after normalizing each variable we can combine them into a matrix which will provide a better weighting scheme than just applying values 0-10 to hydrologic class.***

Hydrologic Soil Type data from gNATSGO was used to estimate the soil's ability to infiltrate water. Four soil types were identified within the study area (fig soil) which were subsequently reclassified from 4 - 10 according to the tablex below.

### Canopy Cover

Reconstructions of pre-settlement ponderosa pine forests have found a range of canopy covers between 10% and 22%, with a median of 16.7% canopy cover[@huffman2012]. However, UAV-analyses of snow pack in thinned and un-thinned ponderosa pine forests within the study area found that canopy cover is highly predictive of snow persistence and that 24 - 35% canopy cover was optimal for maintaining snowpack. [@donager2021; @sankey_multi-scale_2015; @belmonte_uav-based_2021]. However a reduction of 20% canopy cover is necessary to reduce ET and enhance water yield [@adams_ecohydrological_2012] . However thinning treatments are costly and several studies have shown that thinning treatments can lead to soil compaction and reduced infiltration [@moreno2016]. Maximum suitability, then would be the areas with 29-42% canopy cover where the a 20% reduction would result in forests with canopy covers of between 24% and 35%. Higher forest covers could also be suitable but would require more thinning and likely more soil compaction. We set the minimum suitability at 12% canopy cover, since a minimum 20% reduction would result in canopy cover of about 10% the low end of the canopy cover found in pre-settlement forests [@huffman2012].

Canopy Cover was obtained from the 2021 National Land Cover Database , which provides an estimate of Total Canopy Cover (figure x). Canopy cover values ranged from 0% - 86%, the canopy cover data was reclassified using a Gaussian (parabolic) function centering on 35%. The maximum threshold was left at 86%, while the minimum threshold was set to 20%, with a spread of 0.0085. In this way, regions with canopy cover approaching 35% were classified as 10, and suitability classification decreased continuously as canopy cover diverged from th 35% target value.

## Weighting

Pairwise comparisons between each variable were made using the [INOWAS GIS MCDA tool](https://www.inowas.com/tools/t05-gis-mcda/). The pairwise comparisons were The resulting weight schema is presented in Table 1. The weighting had a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.031, values less than 0.1 are considered consistent.

# Results

The total study area was XXXXXX ha. The evaluated study area after masks were applied excluding protected areas, incompatible land use/cover types, and areas receving less than 500mm of maximum precipitation (1991-2020) was 480,000 ha. About 95,000 ha (19.8%) of the areas has suitability values of 5 or greater, about 12,000 ha (2.5%) have suitability values of 6 or greater, and 65 ha with suitability values greater than 7. Leaving about 384,000 ha (77%) with suitability scores less than 5. Importantly, while forest thinning in regions where the suitability score is \<5 is less likely to enhance aquifer recharge, this does not mean that thinning will not enhance aquifer recharge. Conversely areas may be deemed suitable by this analysis but may be unsuitable with other policy or feasibility concerns are considered.

# Conclusion

-   There are significant portions of the Coconino forest that if thinned, are likely to enhance groundwater recharge, however these are not the only benefits. While this study was aimed at maximizing recharge, these same areas are also likely to reduce wildfire risk and improve watershed function enhancing other hydrologic services.

# Discussion

-   novel application of MCDA for mapping areas where forest thinning may enhance groundwater recharge.

-   It could be adapted to other semi-arid forested

-   The Forest Service has a mandate to manage for multiple uses; however, groundwater recharge is not currently an explicitly managed use. Analyses like these can help identify areas that could be managed with aquifer recharge in mind.

## Future Work

-   It is important to adjust the suitability map to capture secondary and tertiary permeability and porosity in areas underlain by karst. This would require improved hydrogeologic mapping of karst surface features paired with dye tracing to understand karst flow paths and areas of high recharge potential.

-   The soil criteria could be refined by mapping soil Hydraulic conductivity and field capacity rather than just using soil types A---D, providing more detail.

-   could be validated with modeling using SWAT or other models

-   Paired watershed studies such as those planned in the Lake Mary Watershed with groundwater monitoring can be used to validate and fine-tune model weighting and decision rules between criteria.

-   this methodology could be used across the 2.6 million acres of Ponderosa Pine forest in Arizona and New mexico

-   State-wide and regional geologic mapping in Arizona is currently only at the 1:500,000 scale, more detailed data could improve this type of suitability mapping.
